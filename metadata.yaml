description: '"The Heart of Princess Osra is part of Anthony Hope''s trilogy of novels
  set in the fictional country of Ruritania and which spawned the genre of Ruritanian
  romance. This collection of linked short stories is a prequel: it was written immediately
  after the success of The Prisoner of Zenda and was published in 1896, but is set
  in the 1730s, well over a century before the events of Zenda and its sequel, Rupert
  of Hentzau. The stories deal with the love life of Princess Osra, younger sister
  of Rudolf III, the shared ancestor of Rudolf Rassendyll, the English gentleman who
  acts as political decoy inThe Prisoner of Zenda , and Rudolph V of the House of
  Elphberg, the absolute monarch of that Germanic kingdom." taken from Wikipedia.'
